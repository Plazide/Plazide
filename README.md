# Hey, what's up? ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Carl.
- I'm freelancing.
- I'm currently working on [Fauna GQL Upload](https://github.com/Plazide/fauna-gql-upload) and many other client projects.
- I'm passionate about web development.

## About me
Whether I want to or not, I'm always learning new stuff that makes me a better developer and person. That's just how it is. Solving problems for a living isn't just good for your financial situation, it is also a great way to improve as a person and learn new skills. I like to believe that when I reach the end of this journey, that has only just begun, I'll be a better person than when it began. Doesn't sound unrealistic, right?
